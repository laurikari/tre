      # Disable globbing in case there are '*' characters in $arg
      # This bug was discovered and reported in PR#87 by Vogtinator
      # on 2022/10/11.  The fix suggested in the PR was to remove
      # the line in tests/agrep/exitstatus.args that contained the
      # '*' character and modify the exitstatus.OK file to match.
      # As Vogtinator pointed out, avoiding the glob expansion is
      # not easy (there may be multiple shell arguments in a line
      # from any of the .args files so escaping the glob character
      # becomes very difficult and error prone).  However, bash
      # shells from 4.4+ and most Almquist shells (e.g. FreeBSD 'sh',
      # Linux 'ash', Debian 'dash', Busybox 'sh', etc.), have a
      # 'noglob' or 'set -/+f' option for disabling globbing.  If
      # this shell script is failing on the 'set -f' below, remove
      # if and the corresponding 'set +f', then remove the line
      # containing the '.*' from exitstatus.args, and the lines
      # produced by that .args line from existatus.ok.  It doesn't
      # seem worth the effort to check the shell version here, because
      # the Almquist shells don't have an easy way to determine the
      # version of the running instance.
